A personal PyTorch project where I’m experimenting with convolutional networks and transfer learning by training a landmark image classifier. The repo includes a custom Dataset implementation and data preprocessing utilities, and the model uses a ResNet-18 backbone for feature extraction.

The model is trained on a subset of the Google Landmarks dataset called "Google Landmarks Dataset v2 micro" found on kaggle by user Kohei: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/confirm/google-landmark-dataset-v2-micro

The Landmark-to-Country mapping is derived from the dataset published on huggingface by user Alexander Visheratin: https://huggingface.co/datasets/visheratin/google_landmarks_places
